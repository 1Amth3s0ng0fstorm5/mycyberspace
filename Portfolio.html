              <strong>My Choice</strong>
              <a href="#">And my new home ICT</a>
              <p>I joined this course because of a background with an ICT
                professional for a father, as a result I grew up around coders and wished to pursue coding to design an
                indie game.
                This dream to make the newer generation smile with something I had made is what propels me foreward
                even when the path is dark.</p>

                  <strong>SWOT Analysis</strong>
                  <a href="#">And its results</a>
                  <p>I have always believed that i have great strengths which are namely: i am kind, chill and overall
                    laid back Personality. I am an honest person and can learn quickly, though this does not mean i do not
                    have faults, i am human. My biggest faults are my combind disorder of aspergers syndrome and ADHD,
                    both of which cause issues for my ability to focus on important tasks and priortize things based on
                    proper values that neurotypicals use.<br><br>with this study i find there is a lot i enjoy, thanks
                    to my major background as a pc builder and amateur programmer it helps me get into the vibe. Now the 
                    workflow is the only thing which has been difficult, as the sheer volume of assignments is hard to 
                    keep up with, though i will never let that deter me as i am the type to push even when others find it
                    stupid.

                  <strong>Programming</strong>
                  <a href="#">How much do I know?</a>
                  <p>I started programming in the most basic way, with logic circuits on bread boards making lights turn on in sequences
                    or strobing at different timings, i then moved into pc building and started coding inside the application Scratch.
                    all while i was 10 years old, then i started coding in python and C++ at the age of 14 and even coded an entire game
                    level in the M.U.D Igor, after this i was in a long hiatus coding every once in a blue moon, then decided to enter this course
                    and started coding in javascript and html for the first time ever.

                  <strong>The Feedback</strong>
                  <a href="#">With their viewpoints</a>
                  <p>Since I started this project i have been recieving feedback on a near daily basis from start to finish.
                    The reason for this is i have been getting advice from other students on each stage of the process in order
                    to test the websites overall feel and ease of use as well as how setup the backend is for those reading the 
                    code. <br><br>as for those who contributed the most; we start with Ruben this man has been helping me since day 1
                    of this project, next we have Serge who has helped me correct code errors and gave me advice on how to optimize better,
                    then we have merciet who helped me review the front end and make sure its "theme" was consistant throughout.

                  <strong>ICT</strong>
                  <a href="#">And what its all about</a>
                  <p>ICT is a profession divided into 3 major groups and the subgroups under those 3.
                    because of the volume of subgroups only the major 3 will be covered and a few subgroups as
                    examples. Now to begin with the 3 major fields are; Software/Web Development, IT Consultancy and Data Science.
                    starting with Software/Web Development, which, as its name suggest is all about the development of applications And
                    websites, which is what we are doing right now. IT Consultancy works on bridging ICT with major companies, their job
                    involves helping these companies build the backend systems that run their buisness to even explaining how that systems
                    works. Finally we have data science and to cover everything would take up 2 wikipedia pages so in short its all about
                    taking data and converting it into real world information which requires a lot of algorithmic thinking and requires you
                    to answer critical questions. <br>
                    and before anyone asks, no i did not forget AI programming, however i do not consider this a major branch
                    as it falls into Software/Web Development since the code is just filled with over-glorified if statements.
