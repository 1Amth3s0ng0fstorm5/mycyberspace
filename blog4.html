          <p class="paragraph">
            <br>Since I started this project i have been recieving feedback on a near daily basis from start to finish.
            The reason for this is i have been getting advice from other students on each stage of the process in order
            to test the websites overall feel and ease of use as well as how setup the backend is for those reading the 
            code. <br><br>as for those who contributed the most; we start with Ruben this man has been helping me since day 1
            of this project, next we have Serge who has helped me correct code errors and gave me advice on how to optimize better,
            then we have merciet who helped me review the front end and make sure its "theme" was consistant throughout.<br><br>
