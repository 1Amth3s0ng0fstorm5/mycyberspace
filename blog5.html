          <h2><br>And what its all about</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <br>ICT is a profession divided into 3 major groups and the subgroups under those 3.
            because of the volume of subgroups only the major 3 will be covered and a few subgroups as
            examples. Now to begin with the 3 major fields are; Software/Web Development, IT Consultancy and Data Science.
            starting with Software/Web Development, which, as its name suggest is all about the development of applications And
            websites, which is what we are doing right now. IT Consultancy works on bridging ICT with major companies, their job
            involves helping these companies build the backend systems that run their buisness to even explaining how that systems
            works. Finally we have data science and to cover everything would take up 2 wikipedia pages so in short its all about
            taking data and converting it into real world information which requires a lot of algorithmic thinking and requires you
            to answer critical questions. <br><br>
            and before anyone asks, no i did not forget AI programming, however i do not consider this a major branch
            as it falls into Software/Web Development since the code is just filled with over-glorified if statements.
